# ClickFunnels-Facebook
The ClickFunnels Login via Facebook will help you capture more leads by simplifying the process.

It is important to note that this will only work on ClickFunnels subdomains because of Facebook's new application security rules. If you require custom domain support, please contact me.

## Getting Started

You will need to place 2 lines of code on your Optin Page

#### Tracking Code

Add this code to the Header Code in your tracking section


`<script src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/funnelux/js/uxfb.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`


#### Widget Code

Place this widget code in the location you would like to display the Facebook Login Button

`<div id="widget"></div>`


I recommend using an email popup as an alernative to having the user optin via Facebook.
